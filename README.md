Project Title: Java-to-Swift Interpreter for a Minimal Programming Language 

Description: 
This project involves building a Java-to-Swift interpreter for a minimal programming language. The interpreter will support basic features like variable assignment, arithmetic operations, conditionals, loops, and iterative control flow. It will process Java code and execute predefined algorithms, translating them into Swift functionality. Additionally, the interpreter will validate and process a simple set of commands and expressions. 

Team Members and Roles: 

1) Otar - Core Interpreter and Control Flow Developer 

   Responsibilities: 

     1. Implement the interpreter logic to process input statements and execute them. 

     2. Develop control flow structures like loops (while) and conditionals (if). 

     3. Handle runtime execution, variable assignment, and error detection. 

     4. Collaborate with Petre to ensure syntax consistency. 

2) Petre - Lexer, Syntax Processor, and Expression Evaluator Developer 

   Responsibilities: 

      1. Develop the lexer to tokenize input code into meaningful components. 

      2. Implement a syntax processor to analyze tokens and ensure syntactic correctness. 

      3. Focus on accurate evaluation of arithmetic and logical expressions. 

3) Dachi - Algorithm Developer and Syntax Validator 

   Responsibilities: 

      1. Write algorithms using the interpreter for tasks like: 

         • Sum of First N Numbers 

         • Factorial of N 

         • GCD of Two Numbers 

         • Reverse a Number 

         • Check if a Number is Prime 

         • Check if a Number is Palindrome 

         • Find the Largest Digit in a Number 

         • Sum of Digits 

         • Multiplication Table 

         • Nth Fibonacci Number 

      2. Test the interpreter by validating its syntax with written algorithms. 

      3. Collaborate with Otar to resolve any issues in execution. 

4) Demiko - Tester and Documentation Specialist 

   Responsibilities: 

      1. Test algorithms written by Dachi to ensure they work correctly.  

      2. Identify and document bugs or inconsistencies in the interpreter or algorithms. 

      3. Ensure clear, user-friendly, and complete documentation for submission. 

      4. Work with Dachi to resolve any issues that arise during testing.
